                In CSS, the hover effect is typically used to change the appearance of an element when the user’s

                elements and you want to disable the hover effect for a specific button, you can assign a class (say
                .disabled) to that button and set the pointer-events property to none for that class.

                selector allows you to apply styles when a specified class is not applied. For example, you can apply
                the hover effect style when a specified class (say .disable) is not applied.
